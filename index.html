                  I found the staff and the Doctor very accommodating and
                  professional. I had no trouble making an appointment to fit my
                  schedule. They were very informative about the procedure I'm
                  about to undertake.

                  Polite, caring, very knowledgeable group of people. I highly
                  recommend this place in a heartbeat. From getting my x-ray
                  from Manos de Cristos to them all the way up to the surgery. I
                  was highly satisfied. If I could give them more than 5 * I
                  would.

                  We went in with such a traumatic experience, the front office
                  staff was so sweet, and answered all questions. Dr. Wildey was
                  awesome. He was patient and so friendly and sweet with my two
                  year old daughter and myself. I would definitely recommend

                  I recently had my first visit at Austin Oral Surgery in
                  Pflugerville and Dr. David Szalay and staff were great.
                  Check-in was efficient and I didn't have to wait long to be
                  roomed. Dr. Szalay was thorough and I greatly appreciated his

                  For someone who has never really had teeth problems for 25
                  years but was told to have two wisdom teeth pulled, I was
                  quite anxious especially being in my 40s. The team there made
                  everything feel routine and simple. It was! Great group of
                  professionals!

                  We had all 4 of our kids wisdom teeth out here. Dr Ding has
                  this down to an art. With our last one, we did the
                  consultation and surgery same day. My children recovered very
                  well, every time. The doctor calls to check on you. I highly
