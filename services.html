              <h2>Veneers</h2>
              <p>
                Improve the aesthetic look of your teeth, and keep them away
                from having a damaged surface. You will be able to color and
                reshape your teeth whether they are too big or too small,
                crooked, shipped, with odd appearance, or contain small holes. A
                lot of things contribute to teeth discoloration. That cig you
                puffed while reading the paper, cup of coffee you drank while
                checking out life insurance quotes online, and other stuff you
                put in your mouth add up and bring damage to your teeth. Your
                teeth discoloration is largely due to chemical damage,
                medications, drinking coffee, tea, or cigarettes or may be even
                congenital or by age. People who drink significant amounts of
                cola soft drinks may experience similar staining.
              </p>
              <h5>
                Genetics can also play a significant role in teeth
                discoloration.
              </h5>
              <p>
                Owing to the global success of the ZOOM one-hour whitening
                systems, Maadi Dental Center has equipped its team with the most
                advanced bleaching machine; ZOOM AP (Advanced Power), to safely
                keep your bright and healthy smile eternal. The operation will
                last for only one hour. The most important issue about teeth
                whitening is the selection of the modality that ensures no
                damaging effect whatsoever on the structure or strength of
                teeth. With this technique employed at MDC, the only trouble one
                may get from teeth bleaching is a temporary sensitivity (in some
                individuals) to hot and cold drinks that will disappear by
                itself in a few days.

              <p>
                Now you will be able to avoid gums bleeding, Abscess formation,
                Foul odor, and loosening of teeth. These symptoms always
                accompany periodontal diseases. Periodontal diseases always
                occur due to bacterial infections, which lead to the distortion
                of attachment fibers and supporting bone that hold your teeth in
                the mouth. Periodontal diseases range from simple gum
                inflammation, called gingivitis, to serious diseases that result
                in further damage to the bone. Now you can put an end to all
                gums-related pains and regain your healthy smile, using the most
                advanced surgical and/or laser treatments aided by a properly
                designed home care programs.

                gum, and keep your teeth in good health by treating your root

              <h2>Implants</h2>
              <p>
                ImplantsYou will experience greater stability to be more able to
                eat, speak... and smile! Through our dental implants treatment,
                we will help you to replace missing teeth, provide you with a
                longer-term solution, slow down bone loss and preserve relevant
                healthy tooth tissue. Even if you are missing several teeth on
                the same side of your mouth, you can still enjoy the benefits
                from our dental implants.
              </p>
              <h5>This is done simply in two phases:</h5>
              <p>
                1. Implant Surgical Insertion Phase: The process of placing the
                implants into the mouth jaw bone.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Prosthetic restoration Phase: Building the crowns or bridges
                over the dental implants. You can have any number of your teeth
                replaced with implants from one single tooth to a complete
                set,and keep your healthy ones intact.
              </p>
              <p>
                Proper clinical and radiographic evaluation is mandatory prior
                to implant treatment planning. Sometimes bone augmentation, bone
                expansion or maxillary sinus membrane lifting is necessary for a
                successful plan. Our team is quite familiar with these
                procedures and can explain them to you easily, then give you the
                right advice whenever needed.

              <p>
                Braces have come a long way since we started in 1984. Prof. Dr.
                Kaboudan is now introducing
              </p>
              <h5>two revolutionary orthodontic systems:</h5>
              <p>
                The Damon System which is a self-ligating brackets, requiring
                less treatment time and no extractions. The ICE brackets which
                are clear braces providing better aesthetics,
              </p>
              <h5>if you prefer not to have braces at all.</h5>
              <p>
                We can align your teeth using INVISALIGN, a set of successive
                clear trays worn over a short period of time, moving your teeth
                gently and silently towards the desired position, without anyone
                realizing them.

                Are mainly used to restore the original functions that your
                damaged or decayed teeth used to perform. Crowns act as a
                protective cover to your teeth. Due to the advanced
                technological tools we use in the Center, you don’t have to pay
                multiple visits to get your dental crowns. Don’t worry, we use

              <p>
                Are used to replace your missing teeth by new ones. They also
                close the gaps between two crowns and fill in the area resulting
                from a missing tooth.
              </p>
              <h5>Dentures</h5>
              <p>
                Are alternative teeth that help you easily replacing one (or
                more) tooth (teeth). You can remove them whenever you want. This
                kind of restorative dentistry is mainly used for those who lost
                their entire upper and/or lower natural teeth.
